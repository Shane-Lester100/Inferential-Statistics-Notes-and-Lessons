# Inferential Statistics: Notes and Lessons

Two categories of statistics are descriptive and inferential. Descriptive statistics is about uncovering information about the observed sample. Those insights can't be generalized because the observed data is only a sample of the population. 

Inferential statistics allow us to understand the properties of distribution by choosing a model and then deducing the properties of that model. The inference results studied here can be in the form of a confidence interval, rejection or failure to reject a hypothesis, or a classification.

These notes cover the topics of probability, conditional probability, and Bayes Theorem because it helps to understand the theory of statistical inference. They also cover how to construct confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression models, and how the three relate to each other.
